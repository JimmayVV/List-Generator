This utility is designed to be used by APDerm (Adult & Pediatric Dermatology) for use in making custom labels to stay compliant with medical regulations.

This utility is used to create a custom formatted txt file, which is designed to be used by MS Word in a mail merge.

Using this as a mail merge will allow Administrative Staff to easily print a large series of custom-formatted labels using a standard Avery Label MS Word template, with standard Avery labels.
